Taking variables:

Enter the number,
Factorial = 1 (initialize by 1)

Process:

In for loop, initialization is equal to the Entered number(i=n)
Testing will run till 'i' is lesser than equal to 1 (i>=1) 
Decrement in i (i--)


Then, put the multiplication formula (fact = fact * i;)

for(i=n;i>=1;i--)
{
	fact = fact * i;
}

Output:
Print the result outside the loop
